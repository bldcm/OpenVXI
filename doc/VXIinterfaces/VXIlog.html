<P><ul>
The VXIlog Facility supports the following types of log streams:

<P><li><b> Error stream:</b><br/>
Used to report system faults (errors) and possible system faults
(warnings) to the system operator for diagnosis and repair. Errors
are reported by error numbers that are mapped to text with an
associated severity level. This mapping may be maintained in a
separate XML document.  This allows integrators to localize and
customize the text without code changes, and also allows integrators
and developers to review and re-define severity levels without code
changes. Optional attribute/value pairs are used to convey details
about the fault, such the file or URL that is associated with the
fault.
</li>

<P><li><b>Diagnostic stream: </b><br/>
Used by developers and support staff to trace and diagnose system
behavior. Diagnostic messages are hard-coded text since they are
private messages that are not intended for system operator
use. Diagnostic messages are all associated with developer defined
"tags" for grouping, where each tag may be independently
enabled/disabled. It is guaranteed that diagnostic logging will have
little or no performance impact if the tag is disabled, meaning that
developers should be generous in their insertion of diagnostic log
messages. These will be disabled by default, but specific tags can
then be enabled for rapid diagnosis with minimal performance impact
when issues arise.
</li>

<P><li><b>Event stream: </b><br/>
Summarizes normal caller activity in order to support service
bureau billing; reporting for capacity planning, application and
recognition monitoring, and caller behavior trending; and traces of
individual calls for application tuning.  Events are reported by
event numbers that are mapped to event names. Optional
attribute/value pairs are used to convey details about the event,
such as the base application for a new call event.
</li>

<P><li><b>Content stream: </b><br/>
The content stream is not really a seperate conceptual stream: it
is merely a mechanism to log large blocks of data (BLOBs) in a 
flexible and efficient manner, for example diagnostic logging of
the VoiceXML page being executed, or event logging of the audio
input for recognition. To log this information, a request to
open a content stream handle is made, then the data is written
to that stream handle. Next the client uses a key/value pair
returned by the VXIlog implementation to cross-reference the
content within an appropriate error, diagnostic, or event log
entry. This mechanism gives the VXIlog implementation high
flexibility: the implementation may simply write each request
to a new file and return a cross-reference key/value pair that
indicates the file path (key = "URL", value = <path>), or may
POST the data to a centralized web server, or may write each 
request to a database. The system operator console software
may then transparently join the error, diagnostic, and event
log streams with the appropriate content data based on the
key/value pair.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<P>Across all streams, the log implementation is responsible for
automatically supplying the following information in some manner
(possibly encoded into a file name, possibly in a data header,
possibly as part of each log message) for end consumer use:
<ul>
<li> timestamp </li>
<li> channel name and/or number </li>
<li> host name </li>
<li> application name </li>
<li> (Error only) error text and severity based on the error number,
and the supplied module name </li>
<li> (Diagnostic only) tag name based on the tag number, and the
supplied subtag name </li>
<li> (Event only) event name based on the event number </li>
</ul>
<p>

<P>In addition, for diagnostic logging the log implementation is
responsible for defining a mechanism for enabling/disabling messages
on an individual tag basis without requiring a recompile for use by
consumers of the diagnostic log. It is critical that Diagnostic( )
is highly efficient for cases when the tag is disabled: in other
words, the lookup for seeing if a tag (an integer) is enabled should
be done using a simple array or some other extremely low-overhead
mechanism. It is highly recommended that log implementations provide
a way to enable/disable tags on-the-fly (without needing to restart
the software), and log implementations should consider providing a
way to enable/disable tabs on a per-channel basis (for enabling tags
in tight loops where the performance impact can be large).

<P><p>
Each of the streams has fields that need to be allocated by
developers. The rules for each follows. As background, several of
these fields require following the rules for XML names: it must
begin with a letter, underscore, or colon, and is followed by one or
more of those plus digits, hyphens, or periods. However, colons must
only be used when indicating XML namespaces, and the "vxi" and "swi"
namespaces (such as "swi:SBprompt") are reserved for use by
SpeechWorks International, Inc.

<P><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Error logging:</b><br/>

<P>Module names (moduleName) must follow XML name rules as described
above, and must be unique for each implementation of each VXI
interface. <p>

<P>Error IDs (errorID) are unsigned integers that for each module
start at 0 and increase from there, allocated by each named module
as it sees fit. Each VXI interface implementation must provide a
document that provides the list of error IDs and the recommended
text (for at least one language) and severity. Severities should
be constrained to one of three levels: "Critical - out of service"
(affects multiple callers), "Severe - service affecting" (affects
a single caller), "Warning - not service affecting" (not readily
apparent to callers, or it is at least fairly likely callers will
not notice). <p>

<P>Attribute names must follow XML name rules as described
above. However, these need not be unique for each implementation
as they are interpreted relative to the module name (and
frequently not interpreted at all, but merely output). For
consumer convenience the data type for each attribute name should
never vary, although most log implementations will not enforce
this. <p>
</li>

<P><li><b>Diagnostic logging:</b><br/>

<P>Tags (tagID) are unsigned integers that must be globally unique
across the entire run-time environment in order to allow VXIlog
implementations to have very low overhead diagnostic log
enablement lookups (see above). The recommended mechanism for
avoiding conflicts with components produced by other developers is
to make it so the initialization function for your component takes
an unsigned integer argument that is a tag ID base. Then within
your component code, allocate locally unique tag ID numbers
starting at zero, but offset them by the base variable prior to
calling the VXIlog Diagostic( ) method. This way integrators of
your component can assign a non-conflicting base as they see
fit. <p>

<P>There are no restrictions on subtag use, as they are relative to
the tag ID and most log implementations will merely output them as
a prefix to the diagnostic text. <p>
</li>

<P><li><b>Event logging:</b><br/>

<P>Events (eventID) are unsigned integers that are defined by each
developer as they see fit in coordination with other component
developers to avoid overlaps.  Globally unique events are required
to make it easy for event log consumers to parse the log, all
events should be well-known and well documented. <p>

<P>Attribute names must follow XML name rules as described
above. However, these need not be unique for each implementation
as they are interpreted relative to the module name (and
frequently not interpreted at all, but merely output). For
consumer convenience the data type for each attribute name should
never vary, although most log implementations will not enforce
this. <p> 
</li>

<P><li><b>Content logging:</b><br/>

<P>Module names (moduleName) must follow XML name rules as described
above, and must be unique for each implementation of each VXI
interface. <p>

<P>When a content stream is opened for writing data, a key/value pair
is returned by the VXIlog interface. This key/value pair must be used
to cross-reference this data in error, diagnostic, and/or event
logging messages. <p>
