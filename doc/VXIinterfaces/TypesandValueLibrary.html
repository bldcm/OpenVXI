The OpenSpeech Browser defines VXI prefixed primitive types to
ensure portability across a wide variety of operating systems. These
types are defined in VXItypes.h, and are used throughout all the
VXI interfaces as well as within implementations of those interfaces.

<P>In addition, the OpenSpeech Browser defines a higher-level data type
library that provides more complex functionality such as vectors,
maps, and reference counted BLOBs (binary large objects) along with
a variant type that allows mixing those plus strings, integers, 
floating point numbers, and pointer values within those data
structures.  These are used throughout all the VXI interfaces in 
order to efficiently pass complex data such as VoiceXML property sets
through those interfaces in order to permit value added VXI 
components without having to modify the VXI interfaces or the 
implementation of other components. <p>

<P>The OpenSpeech Browser implements the VXIvalue library using a highly
efficient C++ implementation which is distributed both with the 
OpenSpeech Browser PIK as well as with the SpeechWorks OpenSpeech 
Recognizer.  Integrators typically do not need to modify this
library, but will almost always need to understand and interact with
this library as it is used throughout the OpenSpeech Browser
interfaces and the reference code. <p>
