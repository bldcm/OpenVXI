<BLOCKQUOTE>HTTP status code, always returned for successful HTTP Open( )
operations, or HTTP Open( ) operations that fail due to the remote
web server returning a HTTP failure code in the HTTP response.
Never returned in other cases (such as for failures for file://
fetches, or failures for HTTP fetches due to non-HTTP response
failures such as TCP/IP connection failures).  HTTP status code
from the last HTTP response received related to the Open( )
request.  Returned as a VXIInteger.  For example, a successful
Open( ) for a http:// URL will most commonly report a HTTP status
200 (OK), while a failed attempt will often report a HTTP status
404 (Not Found).  Note that interim response codes, such as HTTP
status 301 (Redirect -- Moved Permanently) should not be returned
as the VXIinet implementation should respond by doing a HTTP
request against the redirected location, resulting in a new HTTP
status code from the new HTTP response. </BLOCKQUOTE>
