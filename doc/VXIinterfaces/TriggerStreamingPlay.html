<BLOCKQUOTE>Triggers playing an audio stream to the caller, non-blocking </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="DOC.DOCU"></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This routine is asynchronous, in that it does not block - it only
triggers the begin of a play operation. This interface only
supports one play operation at a time, however for streaming
playback this function will be called multiple times by the
client in order to provide the streaming audio as it becomes
available from the streaming source. If another play operation is
initiated via TriggerPlay( ) before this operation completes, a
VXIap_RESULT_BUSY error is returned.
<p>
The first call to TriggerStreamingPlay( ) (while the Audio Player
is in an IDLE state) initiates a streaming play operation. For
streaming plays, every play node will always contain in-memory
audio, never a pointer to a file. The MIME content type and number
of bytes of audio within each play node will not vary within a
single streaming play operation.
<p>
The client merely delivers streaming audio as fast as possible,
making no attempt to recover from network delays (jitter) during
play operations, so the Audio Player should pre-buffer an
implementation defined quantity of audio before actually starting
playback to avoid underruns. The AP_EVENT_STARTING event must
only be delivered once the actual audio starts getting heard by
the caller (playback actually starts). If an underflow does
occur, the Audio Player must deliver an AP_EVENT_WARNING event
with a VXIap_RESULT_STREAM_UNDERFLOW status code to notify the
client, then re-build the pre-buffer before resuming playback
again.
<p>
For flow control, the Audio Player should maintain high and low
watermark thresholds. Whenever the amount of buffered audio is
less then the implementation defined high watermark, accept audio
from TriggerStreamingPlay( ) calls. When that is exceeded,
however return a VXIap_RESULT_STREAM_OVERFLOW error to instruct
the client to suppress additional audio until the Audio Player
delivers an AP_EVENT_RESUME_STREAM event. The Audio Player should
only do so when the amount of buffered audio falls below the low
watermark. This mechanism, where there is some distance between
the low and high watermarks, ensures the flow control is done
efficiently by minimizing the amount of times the audio stream is
paused and resumed, as those operations are relatively expensive.
<p>
When this function returns successfully, ownership of the play
node is passed to the Audio Player, which may then modify the
previous and next pointers as desired to support the
immplementation. The Audio Player is then responsible for calling
the Destroy( ) method of each play node as each node is no longer
needed. If this function returns an error, however, this function
must not have made any changes to the play node (particularly the
previous and next pointers), and ownership is returned to the
client.

progress
<BR>  VXIap_RESULT_SUCCESS on success

any of the play nodes, all content must be passed in-memory
<BR>  VXIap_RESULT_NON_FATAL_ERROR if the MIME content
type is not supported or if the MIME type does not match
the MIME type of the current stream.
<BR>  VXIap_RESULT_STREAM_OVERFLOW if the VXIapInterface is
temporarily unable accept any more playnodes. When it is
ready for more plays the VXIapInterface will issue an
AP_EVENT_RESUME_STREAM event and the application can continue
to calling TriggerStreamingPlay starting with the playnode
that first resulted in the VXIap_RESULT_STREAM_OVERFLOW.
