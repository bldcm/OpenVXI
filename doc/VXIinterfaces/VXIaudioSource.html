<BLOCKQUOTE>
Abstract interface for obtaining audio (speech) from the caller via
a telephony interface, where the audio is provided as in-memory
streaming audio delivered via events. <p>

<P>The Audio Source interface must be implemented for each new
underlying telephony interface, where this is frequently done by a
third party integrator.

<P>There is one Audio Source interface per telephony channel.

<P>The following table summarizes the events delivered by Audio Source
implementations.

<P><table border=0>
<tr><td valign=top><b> AS_EVENT_ERROR </b></td>

<P><td> Reports the Audio Source encountered an error in delivering
audio during a record operation, typically due to an underlying
telephony or I/O error. The error must have occurred after a call
to VXIasTriggerRecord( ) returned with a VXIas_RESULT_SUCCESS
result code, never during that call or after that call returned
with an error.  The Audio Source must be returned to an IDLE state
(the record operation halted) prior to delivering this event.

<P>The event includes a result code that indicates the cause of the
error. </td></tr>

<P><tr><td valign=top><b> AS_EVENT_RECEIVED </b></td>

<P><td> Reports audio (possibly caller speech) that has been received
from the telephony interface. This audio should be echo cancelled
audio (done by the telephony interface or an external device). It
can optionally be from a first-pass speech detector, which uses
the telephony interface or an external device to supporess audio
delivery until potential speech is identified within the audio
stream (either a noise detector or more intelligent speech detector). 

<P>However, if a first-pass speech detector is used (most commonly to
reduce CPU consuption by avoiding streaming silence that occurs
prior to speech), after it detects potential speech it must deliver
audio starting at 250 msec BEFORE the speech detector fired. This
allows a higher-level, more sophisticated endpointer integrated
above this interface to properly scan for low-energy speech that is
important for recognition that first-pass speech detectors commonly
chop off. </td></tr>

<P><tr><td valign=top><b> AS_EVENT_STOPPED </b></td>

<P><td> Reports that a record operation has terminated normally,
either due to the input operation successfully completing or the
record operation being stopped via TriggerStop( ). Audio Source
implementations may also choose to automatically stop the record
operation and return this event on hang-up, although this should
only be done when this is automatic functionality within the
underlying telephony library (the client is responsible for rapdily
calling TriggerStop( ) when hang-up occurs, which in most cases
simplifies the Audio Source implementation by avoiding session
control interactions).

<P>The Audio Source must move from the RECORDING state to an IDLE
state prior to delivering this event. </td></tr>

<P><tr><td valign=top><b> AS_EVENT_OVERFLOW </b></td>

<P><td> Reports the Audio Source has overflowed its internal buffers
while in a PAUSED state and is throwing out audio (the
implementation decides whether to discard audio first-in-first-out
or last-in-first-out). This will not be reported again until the
record operation is resumed and then paused again. The record
operation will otherwise proceed normally once resumed. The PAUSE
state was entered due to the event listener returning
VXIasCb_RESULT_PAUSE_AUDIO for an AS_EVENT_RECEIVED event.
</td></tr>

<P><tr><td valign=top><b> AS_EVENT_LOST </b></td>

<P><td> Reports the Audio Source has detected some audio data was
lost, such as dropped packets on a Voice over IP (VoIP) network. The
event reports the number of bytes lost and the sequence number of
the packet that was lost.
</td></tr>
