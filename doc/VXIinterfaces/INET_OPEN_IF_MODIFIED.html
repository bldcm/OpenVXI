<BLOCKQUOTE>Conditional open, used for cases where a cache outside of
VXIinet is being maintained and the desired object is already
present in that cache, but the user needs to verify whether
that cached object is valid for reuse or not. (For example,
maintaining a compiled grammar cache where the grammar source
is obtained from a URL.) To do so, when writing data to the
cache the user must also store the value of the
INET_INFO_VALIDATOR return property. Then for the next request
for that data, the user must set this property to that validator
object and do an Open( ). If VXIinet_RESULT_NOT_MODIFIED is
returned, the user may re-use the cached data, but must also
update the associated validator with the updated validator
returned in INET_INFO_VALIDATOR. Otherwise if
VXIinet_RESULT_SUCCESS is returned, the cached entry is invalid
and the user obtains a stream from which they must re-create
(re-compile) the data.  (A simple case to understand is file://
access: the validator will usually just be the modification time,
if that changes the cached data is invalid. The need for an opaque
validator and this conditional open mechanism is driven by HTTP 1.1,
where the validator is far more complex, a combination of expiration
times, a modification date, entity tags, and other data.)  Value is
a VXIContent as returned for INET_INFO_VALIDATOR </BLOCKQUOTE>
