<BLOCKQUOTE>
Abstract interface for playing audio to the caller via a telephony
interface, where the audio may be on-disk audio files, in-memory
audio, or in-memory streaming audio. <p>

<P>The Audio Player interface must be implemented for each new
underlying telephony interface, where this is frequently done by a
third party integrator.

<P>There is one Audio Player interface per telephony channel.

<P>The following table summarizes the audio MIME content types that
all Audio Player implementations should support (they typically
support other MIME content types as well). The table after that
summarizes the events delivered by Audio Player implementations.

<P><table border=0>
<tr><td valign=top><b> audio/basic (VXI_MIME_ULAW) </b></td>

<P><td> Raw (headerless) 8kHz 8-bit mono u-law [PCM] single channel
audio (G.711) </td></tr>

<P><tr><td valign=top><b> audio/x-alaw-basic (VXI_MIME_ALAW) </b></td>

<P><td> Raw (headerless) 8kHz 8-bit G.711 mono A-law [PCM] single
channel audio (G.711) </td></tr>

<P><tr><td valign=top><b> audio/x-wav (VXI_MIME_WAV) </b></td>

<P><td> WAV (RIFF header) 8kHz 8-bit mono u-law or A-law [PCM]
single channel audio </td></tr>
</table>

<P><table border=0>
<tr><td valign=top><b> AP_EVENT_STARTING </b></td>

<P><td> Reports the Audio Player moved from the IDLE state to
the PLAYING or STREAMING state. Delivered only for the first play
node in a play or streaming play operation. </td></tr>

<P><tr><td valign=top><b> AP_EVENT_ERROR </b></td>

<P><td> Reports the Audio Player encountered an error in playing
a play node in the play list or a underlying telephony or I/O
error. The error must have occurred after a call to
VXIapTriggerPlay( ) or VXIapTriggerStreamingPlay( ) returned with a
VXIap_RESULT_SUCCESS result code, never during one of those calls
or after one of those calls return with an error.  The Audio Player
must be returned to an IDLE state (the play operation halted) prior
to delivering this event as the user may immediately trigger
additional play operations from within the event listener.

<P>The event includes a result code that indicates the cause of the
error and the playlist node that caused the error (when
available). </td></tr>

<P><tr><td valign=top><b> AP_EVENT_WARNING </b></td>

<P><td> Reports the Audio Player encountered a non-fatal error in
playing a play node in the play list or a underlying telephony or
I/O error that is recoverable.  The error must have occurred after
a call to VXIapTriggerPlay( ) or VXIapTriggerStreamingPlay( )
returned, never during one of those calls or after one of those
calls return with an error.  The warning has no implications on the
current state, if the result of the warning is that the play
operation completed an AP_EVENT_COMPLETED event must be delivered
after this event (or an AP_EVENT_ERROR delivered instead).

<P>The event includes a result code that indicates the cause of the
error and the playlist node that caused the error (when
available). </td></tr>

<P><tr><td valign=top><b> AP_EVENT_COMPLETED </b></td>

<P><td> Reports that a play operation has terminated normally, either
due to the output operation successfully completing or the play
operation being stopped via TriggerStop( ). Audio Player
implementations may also choose to automatically stop the play
operation and return this event on hang-up, although this should
only be done when this is automatic functionality within the
underlying telephony library (the client is responsible for rapdily
calling TriggerStop( ) when barge-in or hang-up occurs, which in
most cases simplifies the Audio Player implementation by avoiding
session control and audio source interactions).

<P>The Audio Player must move from the PLAYING or STREAMING state
to an IDLE state prior to delivering this event. </td></tr>

<P><tr><td valign=top><b> AP_EVENT_RESUME_STREAM </b></td>

<P><td> Reports the Audio Player is ready to resume a streaming audio
source that is currently paused, thus obtaining additional audio
for the current streaming audio operation. The source was paused
when an overflow occured while delivering audio for the streaming
play operation (TriggerStreamingPlay( ) returned
VXIap_RESULT_STREAM_OVERFLOW).  </td></tr>
